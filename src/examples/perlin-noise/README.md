labyrinth generator

function of the app 

This game allows the user to generate a verity of labyrinths and explore the shortest distance it would take to reach the end point.  The users can compare the   distances and  see their changes to the parent shape  can effect the labyrinth. If they wish to further explore they can  even download the generated  geometry  
Features of the app
Geometry of the labyrinth can be controlled through parameters which are as follows 
Radius 
  the radius of the parent shape(sphere) that affects the surface on which the maze is mapped.  Radius ranged between 20 and 70
U-count
  u-count represents the number of divisions of the mesh on its x axis. U count range is between 1 and 30 
V-count
  V-count represents the number of divisions of the mesh on its y axis. V count range is between 1 and 30
Time 
 Perlin noise as described by Ken Perlin is used to   distort the sphere. Time ranged between 0 and 10. 
Scale 
 Perlin noise as described by Ken Perlin is used to   distort the sphere. scale ranged between 0 and 10 which translate to 0   and 0.06.
Seed 
controls the randomness within the algorithm effects how the maze is generated. Seed ranges between 0 and 100.
Start 
 this is the starting point that is used to connect with the end point on the maze through the shortest path as expressed in the app. Points ranges from 0 and 3000 but also depends on u and v counts for total number of points present in the parent shape. 
Tube 
thickness of the shortest path as selected via the start point and a fixed  end point. Tube thickness ranges from 0 to 10. 

Length 
 This variable provides two outputs generated from your choices which are the total length of all the paths within the labyrinth   and the distance of the path you have picked via the start point variable.  

download 
This output allows the user to download the chosen geometry in a 3dm format 



contents of repo
•	here is the repo   that contains  files needed to run  the   labyrinth generator  as a web server 
•	files that have been added  and are useful for the generator  are in src\examples\perlin-noise and \src\files
Location of the generator within the repo
Perlin-noise  folder contains 
1.	the html code 
2.	css code 
3.	js code 
4.	perlin_maze.gh ( found in src\files)

•	these are important to maintain and functioning of web app.
•	html handles the  web interface css handles the aesthetics and js  makes sure  grasshopper files  can connect with  aws  rhino compute server and Heroku  and  .gh  hands the  algorithm that generates the geometry
